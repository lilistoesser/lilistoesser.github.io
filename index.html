				<div id="BioPar"><p>I'm a Robotics Masteres student at the University of Pennsylvania, with a Batchelors degree in Mechanical Engineering. I like to treat engineering like a big puzzle and find new and creative ways to put the pieces together.<br> <br>In my free time I love to dance, I spent my five years at penn as a member of sparks dance company where I had the opportunity to choreograph and perform in a show each semester. If I find myself with any other free time I also love to run, cook, and grow my army of plants!</p></div>
